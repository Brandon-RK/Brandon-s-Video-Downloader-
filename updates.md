## Notice: Support Needed to Keep VKrDownloader Alive

### Dear VKrDownloader Users,

I'm reaching out to let you know that VKrDownloader has hit the free-tier limit on Vercel, which means they've temporarily suspended my account and the server. Since VKrDownloader is a free tool, covering the costs for premium hosting has become challenging. I want to keep VKrDownloader available to everyone, but without support, it’s difficult to continue.

I’m actively working to find a solution, and I’ll keep you updated. If you appreciate VKrDownloader and find it useful, please consider supporting the project. With your help, I can ensure VKrDownloader stays up and running for everyone to use.

Thank you for your understanding and support!

Best,
Vijay Kumar
